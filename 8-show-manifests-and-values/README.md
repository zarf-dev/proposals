**Note:** When your ZEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Create an issue in zarf-dev/proposals.**
  When creating a proposal issue, complete all fields in that template. One of
  the fields asks for a link to the ZEP, which you can leave blank until the ZEP
  is filed. Then, go back and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Name it `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number
  (with no leading zeroes).
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the zep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, complete the "Title", "Authors", "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  Focus on the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections first. If you've already discussed
  the idea with the Technical Steering Committee, this part should be easier.
- [ ] **Create a PR for this ZEP.**
  Assign it to members of the Technical Steering Committee who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Don’t get bogged down in the details—focus on getting the goals clarified and the
  ZEP merged quickly. You can fill in the specifics incrementally in later PRs.

Just because a ZEP is merged doesn't mean it's complete or approved. Any ZEP marked
as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can mark unresolved
sections like this:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing ZEPs, aim for focused, single-topic PRs to keep discussions clear. If
you disagree with a section, open a new PR with suggested changes.

Each ZEP covers one "feature" or "enhancement" throughout its lifecycle. You don’t
need a new ZEP for moving from beta to GA. If new details emerge, edit the existing
ZEP. Once a feature is "implemented", major changes should go in new ZEPs.

The latest instructions for this template can be found in [this repo](/NNNN-zep-template/README.md).

**Note:** PRs to move a ZEP to `implementable`, or significant changes to an
`implementable` ZEP, must be approved by all ZEP approvers. If an approver is no
longer appropriate, updates to the list must be approved by the remaining approvers.

## Summary

<!--
This section is key for creating high-quality, user-focused documentation
like release notes or a roadmap. You should gather this info before
implementation starts to keep the focus on development, not writing. ZEP
editors should ensure the `Summary` is clear and useful for a broad audience.

A good summary should be at least a paragraph long.

Follow the [documentation style guide] for this section and the rest of the ZEP.
Keep line lengths reasonable to make it easier for reviewers to provide
feedback and reduce unnecessary changes.

[documentation style guide]: https://docs.zarf.dev/contribute/style-guide/
-->

Both creators and deployers need a way to view their manifests and values files after Zarf variables are applied.

This will be accomplished through new CLI commands `zarf dev show-manifests`, `zarf dev show-values-fils`, `zarf package show-manifests`, and `zarf package show-values-files`

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this ZEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. You
can also optionally include links to [experience reports], [community slacks],
or other references to show the community's interest in the ZEP.

[experience reports]: https://go.dev/wiki/ExperienceReports
[openssf slack]: https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C07AKUMBDMJ
[kubernetes slack]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03B6BJAUJ3
-->

Viewing manifests and values files after templating would be useful for both creators and deployers. Catching a mistake in templating early can reduce cycle time. A Helm template is almost instant, whereas create + deploy could take several minutes or even an hour+.

A user could achieve a similar effect to this command by unarchiving a package and running `helm template` on their chart. This is a poor UX, and the `helm template` may fail depending on where variable templating is used within the chart.

This feature has been highly requested in recent months:
- request in Kubernetes slack - https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03B6BJAUJ3/p1730229638367829
- An issue has been created for this - https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/issues/2631
- Defense Unicorns, an organization that relies heavily on Zarf for their deployments, have received requests for this feature in a feedback session with their partners.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the ZEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

This is successful for creators when they can view manifests or values files prior to building their package to gain confidence that their templating is working correctly before creating their packages.

This is successful for deployers when they are able to view their templated manifests and values files before deploying.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this ZEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

We do not want to show the manifests of a package that is already deployed. Users can use the [helm get manifest](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_get_manifest/) command to see what Zarf has deployed to the cluster.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where you explain the specifics of the proposal. Provide enough detail
for reviewers to clearly understand what you're proposing, but avoid including
too many specifics like API designs or implementation details. Focus on the
desired outcome and how success will be measured. The "Design Details" section
below is for the real nitty-gritty.
-->

Introduce four new commands. `zarf package show-manifests`, `zarf package show-values-files`, `zarf dev show-manifests`, and `zarf dev show-values-files`. The `package` commands will an already built package, local or OCI, while the `dev` commands will take a package directory.

The help text for `zarf package show-manifests` will look like below. `zarf package show-values-files` will include the same flags.
```
Usage:
  zarf package show-manifests [ PACKAGE_SOURCE ] [flags]

Flags:
      --set stringToString          Specify deployment variables to set on the command line (KEY=value) (default [])
      --kube-version                Override the default helm template KubeVersion when performing a package chart template
      --components                  Comma-separated list of components whose manifests should be displayed.  Adding this flag will skip the prompts for selected components.  Globbing component names with '*' and deselecting 'default' components with a leading '-' are also supported
      --confirm                     Confirms package deployment without prompting. Skips prompts to configure variables and select optional components
```

```
Usage:
  zarf dev show-manifests [ PACKAGE_SOURCE ] [flags]

Flags:
      --create-set stringToString   Specify package variables to set on the command line (KEY=value) (default [])
      --deploy-set stringToString   Specify deployment variables to set on the command line (KEY=value) (default [])
  -f, --flavor string               The flavor of components to include in the resulting package (i.e. have a matching or empty "only.flavor" key)
      --kube-version                Override the default helm template KubeVersion when performing a package chart template
      Confirms package deployment without prompting. Skips prompts to configure variables and select optional components
```

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this ZEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

As a creator of Zarf packages I want to make sure the variables in my package can get templated properly for the expected values of the deployers. I want to check this for both manifests and values files so I run `zarf dev show-manifests path/to/package-dir --deploy-set=MY_VAR=my-val` and `zarf dev show-values-files path/to/package-dir --deploy-set=MY_VAR=my-val`

#### Story 2

As a deployer of Zarf packages, I want to check that the variables I intend to deploy my package with are getting properly templated for both manifests and values files so I run `zarf package show-manifests zarf-package-podinfo-amd64.tar.zst --deploy-set=MY_VAR=my-val` and `zarf package show-values-files zarf-package-podinfo-amd64.tar.zst --deploy-set=MY_VAR=my-val`

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Zarf ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?
-->

Security risks are minimal. This command could print Zarf variables with the `sensitive` value set to true. These variables would be set using values that a user already has access to: user input, configuration files, or the default key in the zarf.yaml file. Given that these commands are expected to be run by a user developing a package or actively managing a cluster or  and not in an automated system we deem these risks acceptable.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss that.
-->

[Internal variables](https://docs.zarf.dev/ref/values/#internal-values-zarf_) will be set using the default logic besides sensitive values which will be set to "PLACEHOLDER". For example, the `ZARF_REGISTRY` variable  become `127.0.0.1:31999`, while `ZARF_GIT_AUTH_PUSH` will be set to "PLACEHOLDER".

Manifests and values files will be printed to standard out.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept proposals with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Zarf testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://docs.zarf.dev/contribute/testing/
-->

[ ] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this proposal.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until you're targeting a release.*

Define what needs to happen for this feature to move from alpha to beta to GA
(General Availability). Focus on key signals or criteria that show the feature
is ready for each stage.

Consider the following stages when setting graduation criteria:
- Alpha: Feature is behind a feature flag, basic tests in place.
- Beta: Gather feedback from users, complete core features, add more tests.
- GA: Prove real-world usage, complete rigorous testing, gather feedback.

In general, features should wait at least two releases between Beta and GA to
allow time for feedback. For features moving to GA, include conformance tests
to ensure stability and compatibility.

#### Deprecation
If this feature will eventually be deprecated, plan for it:
- Announce deprecation and support policy.
- Wait at least two versions before fully removing it.
-->

Given the simplicity of this feature, unit tests will be adequate. 

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
proposal:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  package definition or deployment required to make on upgrade, in order to
  maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  package definition or deployment required to make on upgrade, in order to
  make use of the proposal?
-->

N/A

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
proposal:
- Does this proposal involve coordinating behavior between components?
  - (i.e. the Zarf Agent and CLI? The init package and the CLI?)
-->

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a ZEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling acceptance of the ZEP
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Zarf release where an initial version of the ZEP was available
- the version of Zarf where the ZEP graduated to general availability
- when the ZEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this ZEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

Both commands could have a `--component` flag similar to `zarf package deploy`. This would allow users to get a more accurate view of the manifests that they intend to deploy if their packages include optional components. This would introduce another situation where 

Another alternative is to separate commands dedicated to show the different types of files. `zarf package preview` would be introduced to show the zarf.yaml file. `zarf dev show-manifests` and `zarf dev show-values-files` would show the manifests and values files respectively. The `zarf package inspect` command would be unchanged. Separating `show-manifests` and `show-values-files` would increase the surface area of the CLI, but give the commands a more distinct purpose, and more sensible flags. `show-manifests` and `show-values-files` would have the `--deploy-set` and `--create-set` flags, while `zarf package preview` would only need `--set`. `show-manifests` and `show-values-files` would need a `--kube-version` flag so they can still template charts that have a specific version requirement outside of the default. A `--components` flag could be added for to `show-manifests` and `show-values-files` for users who want to see the manifests they are deploying without optional components included, but wouldn't make sense for the `zarf package preview` command since all components are included on create regardless of if they are used or not. The `show-manifests` and `show-values-files` commands would take either a zarf.yaml or a zarf package.
