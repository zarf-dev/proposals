<!--
**Note:** When your ZEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Create an issue in zarf-dev/proposals.**
  When creating a proposal issue, complete all fields in that template. One of
  the fields asks for a link to the ZEP, which you can leave blank until the ZEP
  is filed. Then, go back and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Name it `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number
  (with no leading zeroes).
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the zep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, complete the "Title", "Authors", "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  Focus on the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections first. If you've already discussed
  the idea with the Technical Steering Committee, this part should be easier.
- [ ] **Create a PR for this ZEP.**
  Assign it to members of the Technical Steering Committee who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Don’t get bogged down in the details—focus on getting the goals clarified and the
  ZEP merged quickly. You can fill in the specifics incrementally in later PRs.

Just because a ZEP is merged doesn't mean it's complete or approved. Any ZEP marked
as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can mark unresolved
sections like this:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing ZEPs, aim for focused, single-topic PRs to keep discussions clear. If
you disagree with a section, open a new PR with suggested changes.

Each ZEP covers one "feature" or "enhancement" throughout its lifecycle. You don’t
need a new ZEP for moving from beta to GA. If new details emerge, edit the existing
ZEP. Once a feature is "implemented", major changes should go in new ZEPs.

The latest instructions for this template can be found in [this repo](/NNNN-zep-template/README.md).

**Note:** PRs to move a ZEP to `implementable`, or significant changes to an
`implementable` ZEP, must be approved by all ZEP approvers. If an approver is no
longer appropriate, updates to the list must be approved by the remaining approvers.

## Summary

<!--
This section is key for creating high-quality, user-focused documentation
like release notes or a roadmap. You should gather this info before
implementation starts to keep the focus on development, not writing. ZEP
editors should ensure the `Summary` is clear and useful for a broad audience.

A good summary should be at least a paragraph long.

Follow the [documentation style guide] for this section and the rest of the ZEP.
Keep line lengths reasonable to make it easier for reviewers to provide
feedback and reduce unnecessary changes.

[documentation style guide]: https://docs.zarf.dev/contribute/style-guide/
-->

`zarf package publish` accepts either a directory with a `zarf.yaml` file or a created Zarf package. The behavior when accepting a directory is to create and publish a [skeleton package](https://docs.zarf.dev/faq/#what-is-a-skeleton-zarf-package). This is not intuitive, the average user would most likely expect a package to be built then published. They likely wouldn't know what a skeleton package is as well.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this ZEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. You
can also optionally include links to [experience reports], [community slacks],
or other references to show the community's interest in the ZEP.

[experience reports]: https://go.dev/wiki/ExperienceReports
[openssf slack]: https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C07AKUMBDMJ
[kubernetes slack]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03B6BJAUJ3
-->

We have seen multiple questions in Kubernetes slack asking why their package was published without images. The user assumed it was a bug, instead it was the skeleton package feature. 

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the ZEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

- Make the package publish command more intuitive and less prone to user error 

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this ZEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

- Change the content of publish packages, this is focused on the CLI experience

## Proposal

<!--
This is where you explain the specifics of the proposal. Provide enough detail
for reviewers to clearly understand what you're proposing, but avoid including
too many specifics like API designs or implementation details. Focus on the
desired outcome and how success will be measured. The "Design Details" section
below is for the real nitty-gritty.
-->

`zarf package publish <directory>` will be deprecated. Instead the command will only take an already built package. To publish skeleton packages users will use `zarf package publish skeleton <directory>`.  

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this ZEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

I want to publish my Zarf package to an OCI registry so I run `zarf package publish my-package.tar.zst`

#### Story 2

I want to publish my skeleton package to an OCI registry so I run `zarf package publish skeleton my-directory`

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Zarf ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?
-->

This will deprecate the current way to publish skeleton packages, forcing users to change their workflows. Since this deprecation has a clear 1:1 alternative, and we will give users one year before the current functionality is removed this is deemed low risk. 

One situation that would break immediately is if a user is if a user is currently running `zarf package publish skeleton` to publish a skeleton package in their directory called skeleton. After this ZEP's implementation Zarf will look for a `zarf.yaml` in their current directory rather than the skeleton directory. Still, their issue should be clear after looking at the help text. 

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss that.
-->

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept proposals with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Zarf testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://docs.zarf.dev/contribute/testing/
-->

[ ] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this proposal.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until you're targeting a release.*

Define what needs to happen for this feature to move from alpha to beta to GA
(General Availability). Focus on key signals or criteria that show the feature
is ready for each stage.

Consider the following stages when setting graduation criteria:
- Alpha: Feature is behind a feature flag, basic tests in place.
- Beta: Gather feedback from users, complete core features, add more tests.
- GA: Prove real-world usage, complete rigorous testing, gather feedback.

In general, features should wait at least two releases between Beta and GA to
allow time for feedback. For features moving to GA, include conformance tests
to ensure stability and compatibility.

#### Deprecation
If this feature will eventually be deprecated, plan for it:
- Announce deprecation and support policy.
- Wait at least two versions before fully removing it.
-->

The `zarf package publish skeleton` feature will be stable on it's first release. `zarf package publish <directory>` will give a deprecation notice and call to action to use `publish skeleton`. `zarf package publish <directory>` will be removed one year after it is deprecated. 

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
proposal:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  package definition or deployment required to make on upgrade, in order to
  maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  package definition or deployment required to make on upgrade, in order to
  make use of the proposal?
-->

N/A

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
proposal:
- Does this proposal involve coordinating behavior between components?
  - (i.e. the Zarf Agent and CLI? The init package and the CLI?)
-->

N/A

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a ZEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling acceptance of the ZEP
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Zarf release where an initial version of the ZEP was available
- the version of Zarf where the ZEP graduated to general availability
- when the ZEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this ZEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

### Create skeleton tar package
Another option is to create a skeleton tar package with a command like `zarf package create --skeleton`. This would keep the `zarf package publish` command simple, it would take either a regular tar or a skeleton tar. This option wasn't selected as skeleton packages are only useful in OCI registries. By introducing a tar version of skeleton packages Zarf will have to build in error cases to ensure a user can't try to deploy or mirror resources using them. Skeleton packages may work with the `package remove` and `package inspect` commands as well, but we don't  work with remove or
